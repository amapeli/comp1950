        <h1>Web space/FTP</h1>
      </header>
	  <p>
		Each student will get personal webspace. This may be different than in the past, as this space is exclusively yours, with your own username and password.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		This is also not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more. Make it a site that is usable and functional.
	  </p>
	  <h2>TheNet Setup</h2>
      <ul>
		<li>You will create your account in the system one by one</li>
		<li>Be prepared to enter your:
			<ul>
				<li>directory name</li>
				<li>username</li>
				<li>password</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>TIP:</b> Use your BCIT ID and Password (used for logging into lab computers) to make it easier</li>
		<li>You will enter your information to create account</li>
		<li>The account is created immediately</li>
		<li>Your URL will be: <b>http://students.thenet.ca/{name}</b></li>
      </ul>
	  
	  <h2>FTP into your Account</h2>
	  

	  <p>
		You can use any FTP program you are comfortable with. There is most likely one installed in the labs (it changes from term to term) but you can download and install any one you want.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		If you aren't knowledgeable with any FTP programs yet, just let me know!
	  </p>
	  <p>Here is the relevant information you will need to know:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Host / IP / URL: <b>www.thenet.ca</b></li>
		<li>Username: <b>{the username you chose}@thenet.ca</b></li>
		<li>Password: <b>{the password you entered}</b></li>
	  </ul>

      <p>Create your course web site: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Check out the example page created by a past student: <a href="http://past.thenet.ca/lori/">Lori's Example</a></li>
		<li>Specifically, what I would like to see: </li>
		<li>On your homepage: 
			<ul>
				<li>Include some information about yourself (such as from your introduction today) including a photo</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For week one: 
			<ul>
				<li>A brief overview of your skill level, web development work you have done so far (if any), links to favourite sites</li>
				<li>A list of tools, plug-ins, applications or IDEs that you use for web development, including links to web pages of these tools.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to the limit of your knowledge, but ensure that it is usable, presentable and coherent</li>
		<li>This site will be used for the rest of the course, edited each week</li>
		<li>If we do an exercise in class or if you are assigned something for homework, please make sure you indicate that. Link to exercises and assignments from the appropriate week. <i>Don't make me have to search for your homework.</i></li>
		<li>There needs to be a link from the <b>myBCIT Members page</b> to your Student Homepage</li>
